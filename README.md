# 🧬 ChIP-seq Analysis Pipeline (Nextflow + Docker)

This pipeline performs full ChIP-seq analysis on multiple samples, including quality control, alignment, peak calling, peak annotation, and signal visualization near TSS.

Each sample should have its own folder containing ChIP and Input FASTQ files. The pipeline is powered by [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for portability and reproducibility.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Quality control with FastQC
- 🧬 Alignment using Bowtie2
- 🧪 Mark duplicates with GATK
- 📈 Peak calling with MACS2
- 🧠 Peak annotation with ChIPseeker (R/Bioconductor)
- 📊 BAM QC with samtools flagstat
- 🧩 MultiQC reporting
- 🔥 Heatmap visualization using deepTools and TSS regions

## 📂 Input Structure

Place your FASTQ files like this:

data/ ├── Sample1/ │ ├── chip_R1.fastq.gz │ └── input_R1.fastq.gz ├── Sample2/ │ ├── chip_R1.fastq.gz │ └── input_R1.fastq.gz ...

## 📦 Output Includes

- `*_fastqc.html`: QC reports
- `*.bam`: sorted and deduplicated BAM files
- `*_peaks.narrowPeak`: MACS2 peaks
- `*_annotated.txt`: annotated peaks
- `chip_flagstat.txt`: samtools stats
- `multiqc_report.html`: aggregated QC
- `*_heatmap.png`: ChIP signal heatmap around TSS
